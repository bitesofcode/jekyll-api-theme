To use this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) server, you just need to fork the 
[jekyll-api-theme](https://github.com/bitesofcode/jekyll-api-theme) project into your own repository, and 
start adding content in the `_posts` folder.

The way the documentation generates, you will need to create 2 posts for your content.  The first content will
render as text documentation in the center column.  The second content will render as example code in the right-most
column.

This is an example of a post rendering in the main column.

To define posts as sections in the sidebar to the left, you simply need to add a `section` parameter to the post
header.
